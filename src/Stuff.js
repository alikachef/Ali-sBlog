          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Rich in Omega3. <span class="read-more-target"> Sushi is rich in Omega3 fish oils, which are classed as essential fats, as the body can’t make them. They have a host of health benefits, including reducing high cholesterol levels, the risk of heart disease and overall inflammation, as well as lowering blood pressure, triglycerides and maintaining heart rhythm. </span> </li>
         
          <li class="read-more-wrap">Cut cravings<span class="read-more-target"> Fish is an excellent source of protein that balances blood sugar and keeps energy levels stable, leading to longer spells of satiety, enhanced metabolism and less snacking between meals, encouraging steady and safe weight loss. Go for ‘fishier’ choices with vegetables like Salmon or Tuna Sashimi </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap">Brain food <span class="read-more-target"> The fish in sushi is the number one brain food! Omega3 fatty acids nourish and repair brain cells and, as fish is also rich in protein and essential fats, it helps focus the mind, increase concentration and maintain energy. So sushi is your perfect aldesko or alfresco lunchtime option at work. </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Mood stabilisers <span class="read-more-target"> By regularly eating sushi, the fish oils may help with more serious conditions like psychosis and bipolar disorders. Fish is also high in Vitamin B12, which keeps the brain ‘happy’ and staves off bouts of depression, anxiety and brain fog </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Wrinkle prevention <span class="read-more-target"> Sushi is a prolific source of antioxidants, which slows down cell damage, prevents permanent oxidative damage to the skin and slows down overall ageing. These antioxidants preserve the cell structure of the skin, help keep cells younger both externally and internally and are integral to anti-aging diets! </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Stave off osteoporosis <span class="read-more-target"> Fish is also an exceptional source of calcium, the primary mineral for bone health. Eating sushi regularly may help to keep joints healthy and stave off more serious conditions like osteoporosis. Calcium also forms the essential ‘building blocks’ for healthy hair and nails. </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Memory booster <span class="read-more-target"> The high level of Omega3 essential fats in sushi fish helps boost memory and can also help with cognitive function, so eating regular sushi meals is beneficial for all ages to help protect the brain and maintain healthy cognition. </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Muscle repair <span class="read-more-target"> Sushi is also an excellent source of protein and, if exercising regularly, it can aid muscle repair and recovery. For maximum benefit have sushi at least two or three times a week as part of your health and fitness regime. </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap">Immunity boost <span class="read-more-target"> Sushi is also packed with other essential co-factor minerals, such as zinc, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and iron, which play an important role in energy production and immunity. Vitamin A, Carotene, Vitamin C and Retinol are plentiful too (Vitamin A and C are more prevalent in vegetarian sushi). </span> </li> 
          <li class="read-more-wrap"> Opt out of obesity <span class="read-more-target"> Sea vegetables like kombu, nori and wakame, which are essentially the types of seaweed found in sushi, are high in iodine. Iodine helps in the prevention of hypothyroidism or low thyroid function which, if uncontrolled, may lead to obesity and lethargy.</span> </li>
