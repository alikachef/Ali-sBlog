        <p>Before the sushi craze hit American shores, sushi actually first began in Southeast Asia before spreading to China and then hitting Japan around the 8th century. This was all thanks to a simple dish where fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice. It was not until Japan, however, when they started eating the fermented rice along with the fish, and that’s when the sushi, that we all know and love, was born. Humble beginnings for an amazing food that we just can’t get enough of, and thank goodness for that because there’s so much goodness in sushi.</p>
